# Non-functional properties of Distributed Systems in AWS EMR
**Author:** Marcel León Lafebré

**Introduction**

This guide lets students observe and analyze some non-functional properties of Distributed
Systems, including performance, fault tolerance, and scalability, through a series of hands-on
experiments. The experiments involve executing SQL queries on a data lake, using Apache
Spark on AWS EMR.

The following sections outline the teaching objectives of this guide and highlight the intended
audience and prerequisites. This laboratory guide has been designed for execution within an
AWS Academy Learner Lab environment.

**Objectives**

This laboratory guide will teach you how to:
* Use AWS services such as Athena and EMR to analyze large data volumes and
the Cloudwatch tool to monitor the metrics of an EMR cluster.
* Prepare an environment for benchmarking a Big Data platform with the benchmark
“TPC-DS” on AWS.
* Configure and launch an Elastic MapReduce (EMR) cluster running Spark.
* Measure the performance of an EMR cluster.
* Observe how an EMR cluster uses redundancy to achieve fault tolerance behavior.
* Observe the scalability of an EMR cluster.

**Intended audience**

This laboratory guide is tailored for students pursuing undergraduate or graduate studies in
Computer Science or related programs, who are interested in gaining practical experience in
deploying an EMR cluster in AWS and understanding the impact of different configuration options on
the non-functional properties of these clusters.

**Prerequisites**

We recommend that students have prior knowledge of Distributed Systems and Big Data concepts,
as well as familiarity with AWS academy and to run the Lab Environment furthermore the AWS tools
and services. Specifically the creation of rules to enable server ports and access from specific IPs,
as well as using key pairs to access the nodes. Students can refer to the Appendix section if
needed.

## Process for setting up an environment with TPC-DS in AWS for benchmarking Big Data querying platforms

This exercise must be carried out in an AWS Academy Learner Lab environment. First, you
need to set up an S3 bucket and configure Athena, as described below:

1\. Create an **Amazon S3 bucket** using S3 service with default permissions and the name that
you decide (being a string unique in your environment), for example, **_“athenabucketmll”_** where
you could replace **_“mll”_** with the initials of your name.

The following image shows the S3 bucket created.
![Athena Conf](img/athena_conf.png)
2\. Go to the Athena Service and access the SQL query editor, then you have to configure it
using **_"Edit Settings"_**. Assign the bucket created in the field query result location, note that you
can write the location or select it in a search.
![Athena Conf](img/athena_conf2.png)
Once Athena is configured, continue with the following steps of the lab:

3\. This work uses the official repository of [AWS Labs for Redshift utils](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils/tree/master/src/CloudDataWarehouseBenchmark/Cloud-DWB-Derived-from-TPCDS/1TB), specifically employing
the **_1 TB TPC-DS_** which is an industry-standard benchmark to evaluate the performance of
systems for big data analytics; it simulates the data and typical queries of the data warehouse,
offering different sizes of information. In summary, it provides data to test systems
related to information consumption with Big Data queries. The script file ddl.sql contains the
commands to create the database tables on Redshift, an AWS product designed for storing
large data volumes but in this case, you will adapt to run in Athena as a datasource.

4\. These tables are created as files stored on S3. For this, you will use Athena to execute the
scripts, but you need to make a few changes first.
* Create a database with the following code:
```
CREATE DATABASE tpcds_1tbrs;
```
![TPCDS DB](img/tpcds_db.png)

5\. The ddl.sql file located in the link of the previous step contains CREATE statements for the tables, which you should modify as indicated from this until the 9 step and repeat for every table. **We recommended read or following the steps to understand the changes at least once, but if you consider, you can use the following file with the scripts https://github.com/marcelleonlafebre/lab_manualcloud/blob/main/tables.sql to create every table in Athena and go directly to step 10**:
* In each **“CREATE”** statement, replace **“CREATE TABLE”** with **"create external
table"**. This is needed because the data files are stored in an external bucket that you
do not own.

6\. Inside the CREATE statement you will find the definition of each field of the table with its
name followed by the datatype. You will modify:
* The data types **_"integer"_**, **_"int8"_** or **_"int4"_** by **_"int"_**, and
* The data types **_"numeric"_** by **_"decimal"_** with the same precision described after the data
type inside parenthesis.

This is needed because are the data types accepted by Athena.
7\. Also, inside the CREATE statement you will have to modify the following:
* **_Delete_** the **_definitions_** of **_"primary key"_** because Athena does not enforce primary keys.
* **_Delete_** the **_null fields_** **_definitions_** to match with the data of the benchmark TPC-DS.
* **_Delete_** the following **_declarations: diststyle, distkey_**, and **_sortkey_** because they are
specific commands for Redshift.
Insert the following **_code block_** at the end with important properties of the tables as the
format or compression type. You have to refer to the link of the S3 file published by the
TPC-DS framework for the data population e.g.
s3://redshift-downloads/TPC-DS/2.13/1TB/**_date_dim_**/. Take into account that the file
name (in bold and italic: date_dim) changes depending on the table and the link must go
between quotes.
```
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('field.delim' = '|')
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat'
OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
LOCATION 's3://redshift-downloads/TPC-DS/2.13/1TB/date_dim/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'classification' = 'csv',
  'write.compression' = 'GZIP'
);
```
For example, the following code is similar to the original file and highlights the words to change:\
create table tabla_ejemplo(\
&emsp;field1 **integer**,\
&emsp;field2 **int8**,\
&emsp;field3 **int4**,\
&emsp;field4 **numeric**(4,2));
   
The following text shows the example of the final script highlighting in bold the words added or
changed:
```
create external table tabla_ejemplo(
field1 int,
field2 int,
field3 int,
field4 decimal(4,2))
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('field.delim' = '|')
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat'
OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
LOCATION 's3://redshift-downloads/TPC-DS/2.13/1TB/tabla_ejemplo/'
TBLPROPERTIES ( 'classification' = 'csv', 'write.compression' = 'GZIP'
);
```
8\. The script will run in Athena and must reply **_“Query successful”_**.
![Sample Output](img/script_table_exc.png)

9\. Repeat the modification of the script and its execution for every table of the TPC-DS
repository, ensuring that database tpcds_1tbrs is selected in the combo box labeled Database.
In our experiment, we initially will create five tables: **date_dim, item, inventory, and
warehouse**, which are used in **query number 21** in this repository https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils/tree/master/src/CloudDataWarehouseBenchmark/Cloud-DWB-Derived-from-TPCDS/1TB/queries.

The script of query number 21 has been chosen as a goal of running it because in the following
research was not possible to execute it in an EMR Cluster with Spark:
https://www.concurrencylabs.com/blog/starburst-enterprise-vs-aws-emr-sql-tpcds/. However,
you can use any query that takes at least 3 minutes in Athena.

10\. After executing the previous steps, the tables will be ready to be accessed via the data
source type: AWS Glue Data Catalog, enabling the TPC-DS data to be accessible from the
EMR Clusters by only marking the check of one property when you create the cluster.

## Configure and run an EMR Cluster with access to the TPC-DS Big Data repository
Before continuing to the following steps, you can refer to the official documentation on the
architecture of the EMR Cluster service for a thorough understanding. Next are two links that we
suggest that you read if you do not know the EMR Cluster service:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-overview-arch.html\
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html\
The EMR Cluster service supports technologies such as Hadoop, Presto, or Spark. In this lab,
we will use Apache Spark, as it is one of the most commonly used Big Data platforms in the
industry.

Here are the steps you need to follow to set up an EMR Cluster for Apache Spark:\
1\. Click **_"Create Cluster"_** to initialize the EMR Cluster service. Then, enter a name for the
cluster, and select the **_default_** version of the EMR Cluster, which generally is the last version
released by the service. Then, proceed to select the **_"Spark Interactive"_** application package.

2\. Mark the check **_“Use for Spark table metadata”_** to connect the cluster with the data layer
created in the previous section "Process for setting up an environment with TPC-DS in AWS for
Benchmarking Big Data platforms".
![EMR 1 SPARK](img/cluster1.png)
3\. Configure the **_service role_** and **_instance profile_** role choosing **_default roles_**.

4\. Configure the provisioning of nodes for the cluster using the **_“Add task instance group”_**
button to create more task nodes. To consider the restrictions of using the EMR tool within an
AWS Lab Environment which are the following:
| **Restriction** | **value** |       
| ------------------------------ | --------- |  
| **Max.vCPU** | 32 concurrent running |
| **Max.number of nodes** | 9 concurrent running |
| **EC2 Instance size** | large o smaller |

> Note that "large" EC2 instances have 8 GB of memory RAM, which is important as
Apache Spark relies on memory as its primary resource, resulting in accelerated loading
of tables and execution of operations. You can go to this link to review Apache Spark:
https://aws.amazon.com/es/what-is/apache-spark/.
With the mentioned restrictions you can only create **_7 task nodes_** of **_instance type
m4.large_** as shown in the following image:
![EMR 1 SPARK](img/Cluster3.png)

4\. Finally, the cluster has been created with the following information:
![EMR 1 SPARK](img/Cluster_final1.png)
![EMR 1 SPARK](img/cluster_final2.png)

> Note: Don’t forget to choose the key-pair and enable access to the core node of the
cluster by enabling access to the SSH port from your IP, using an inbound rule as
indicated in the appendix section.

Here is the summary of configurations to consider in the cluster creation:
| **Config file attribute name** | **value** |       
| ------------------------------ | --------- |      
| **spark version** | Default version |
| **Amazon EC2 key pair for SSH to the cluster** | Select the name of your EC2 key pair |
| **Additional security groups for primary node (firewall)** | Select the name of the security group created |
| **Instance-type**      | m4.large |
| **region** | Your test region. Make sure the source data has been copied to the test region. For example: `us-east-1`|
| **Service role** | `EMR_DefaultRole` By default. 
| **Instance profile** | `EMR_EC2_DefaultRole` Make sure this role exists in your account. By default EMR creates this role when launched on the Management console. You can manually create this role by running: `aws emr create-default-roles` Please refer the [CLI doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-default-roles.html). |
| **Quantity of task nodes**         | 7                                           |
| **Quantity of primary nodes**         | 1                                           |
| **Quantity of core nodes**         | 1                                           |

Once the cluster is in the **_“waiting” state_** you must connect via SSH to the main node with the
following command in a terminal window; don’t forget to replace the name of the key pair file
with the full path of your computer and the file name of your key-pair and connect to the IP
address of the **_primary node public DNS_** of the cluster:
```
ssh -i emr-keypair.pem ec2-user@IP address of the primary node public DNS.
```
If you can not connect to your cluster, go to the **_ec2 instance_** and set the appropriate **_inbound
rule_**, as indicated in the [Appendix](#appendix:-pre-requisite-knowledge;-refer-to-this-section-if-it-is-unclear-how-to-execute-one-or-more-steps-in-the-guide).

## Observe the fault tolerance behavior in an EMR cluster using redundancy
Fault tolerance is a very important property for a system that offers services even when one or
more components fail (Priti Kumari and Parmeet Kaur, 2021). Redundancy is the basic
technique of fault tolerance that focuses on duplicating crucial resources or elements in the
system (Kamil, I. A., & Al-Askari, M. A., 2024).\
You need access to the cluster connecting for SSH protocol with its public IP address,, log in
with the default user **_“ec2-user”_** and use the key-pair as was explained at the end of the
previous section.\
Next, you have to elevate privileges to root with the following command:
```
sudo su -
```
Enter to the environment of Spark and launch queries with the spark-sql tool using the following
command:
```
spark-sql
```
Run the command **_“use”_** to locate the database previously created as follows:
```
use tpcds_1tbrs;
```
Note that every command executed in spark-sql must end with a semi-colon (;). You can
modify the queries in this lab to experiment with other examples. For example, you can
execute a count of the inventory table that has 11.67GB in total size with the following
command:
```
select * from inventory where inv_date_sk = 2451466;
```
For you to understand how Apache Spark works, for the execution of the query of all rows of the
inventory table on the EMR cluster, Spark must load in memory approximately 783 million
records. The size of one record in the 'inventory' table is 16 bytes (source:
https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v2.1.0.pdf, page 36), requiring
the cluster to have a capacity of nearly 12 GB of memory for our TPC-DS database experiment
with a scale of 1 TB database.

It's worth noting that, considering the constraints of the environment, the cluster was configured
with 9 nodes, each with a size type "large" of EC2 instances and 8 GB of memory, totaling 72
GB of memory in the cluster. Additionally, keep in mind that other processes and components
within the cluster also use memory, such as the operating system and others.

Returning to the experiment, you will use a variant of query number 21. Its execution takes
almost 191 seconds in the EMR Cluster, more than 3 minutes. You have to copy and paste the
following code into the server which is a variant of query 21 for running in Spark:
```
select *
from(select w_warehouse_name
            ,i_item_sk
            ,sum(inv_quantity_on_hand) as inv_sum
     from inventory, warehouse, item, date_dim
     where i_current_price between 0.99 and 1.49
     and i_item_sk=inv_item_sk
     and inv_warehouse_sk=w_warehouse_sk
     and inv_date_sk=d_date_sk
     and d_date between cast('2000-02-11' as date) and cast('2000-04-11' as
date) group by w_warehouse_name, i_item_sk) x
where inv_sum between 0.6 and 1.5
order by w_warehouse_name,i_item_sk
limit 100;
```
**_Take into account that the following steps need to be executed while the query is
running_**, for this is important to do it with a query that takes a minimum of 3 minutes to execute.

You will manually introduce a failure in the cluster to test the fault tolerance properties of Spark
going down a task node. For this, you have to **_enter the AWS console by browser_** go to
the **_section of cluster details_** of the cluster running, and next enter the **_“Instance Groups”
panel_** to **_set the instance group's size to zero_** for the node that you want to go down, using
the **_resize option_** as the following image show:
![Fault Tolerance Demo 1](img/ft_demo_1.png)
> Is important to remark that if these steps are not followed, the EMR Cluster will attempt
to launch a new instance of the node. If only one node is taken offline, the Cluster will
use its default **Autoscaling** feature and deploy a new instance of the same node.

Once you have identified the instance, take it offline using the **_button actions_** to stop it
and verify its **_state_** changes to **_“stopping”_**.

![Fault Tolerance Demo 2](img/ft_demo_2.png)
![Fault Tolerance Demo 3](img/ft_demo_3.png)

After some communication attempts while the node was down, the Spark EMR Cluster
successfully executed the query with the same results as Athena.\
The image below is the log with the error messages from the Spark cluster while the query is
being executed.

![Fault Tolerance Final](img/ft_final.png)
Finally, as a complement it is important to remark that there are default parameters in the
EMR Spark Cluster that are significant, such as the 100-second timeout for validating
connections among nodes and the 30-minute timeout for query resolution.\
This experiment showed that the Spark EMR Cluster can regulate its processes and function
effectively to get the query results, even with one less node.\
> Please remember that you'll have to terminate the cluster in the AWS to avoid the deactivation of the AWS account. You can only start one cluster at a time.  


## Observe measurements of the performance of an EMR Cluster using CloudWatch
The performance of an EMR Cluster can be observed with CloudWatch. It allows monitoring and
visualizing metrics in 3 dimensions of an EMR Cluster: cluster state, state of nodes, and inputs
and outputs such as S3, hard disk, and memory. For more details about this tool, see
https://aws.amazon.com/es/cloudwatch/. The metrics in the CloudWatch dashboard offer
real-time insights into the health and performance of the cluster and its nodes. These metrics
provide valuable information on the processes of different jobs running their steps and the
component negotiator for more resources
(https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html).\
You can review the following metrics while you run the query used in the demonstration of fault
tolerance or run the following in the Spark cluster:
```
select count(1) from the inventory;
```
![Metrics](img/metrics.png)
![Metrics](img/metrics1.png)
The next two images show the metrics dashboard for a node. Cloudwatch lets us monitor the
health and performance of all nodes in the EMR cluster. These metrics show the nodes in
various states such as running, pending, rebooting, or experiencing problems.
![Metrics](img/metrics2.png)
![Metrics](img/metrics3.png)
Moreover, the dashboard also presents metrics for inputs and outputs of the cluster, with a specific
focus on memory indicators due to the use of Spark technology. In our case, the metrics related to
storage are not relevant as our experiment uses data stored in S3.
![Metrics](img/metrics4.png)
![Metrics](img/metrics5.png)

## Observe the scalability of an EMR cluster
Scalability is the ability of computer systems to generally increase but also decrease
components to changes in processing demands for solving tasks (Sehgal, N. K., Bhatt, P. C. P.,
& Acken, J. M., 2023).

To demonstrate the scalability in our exercise we will do two manual experiments: first, you will
have to exec the query of this guide in an EMR Cluster with a x number of nodes and then another execution with more number of nodes so the time of execution of the same query should be better due to greater amount of resources.

Remember when you create the EMR Cluster to use the security group and to link the key-pair,
both created previously in the experiments and review your public IP is configured in the
inbound rules.

In any case, below are 2 illustrative images of the creation of the cluster:
![Scalability1](img/scalability1.png)
![Scalability2](img/scalability2.png)
Then, when the cluster is in a **_“waiting” state_** you will enter the cluster through the terminal as
explained in the section **_“Configure and run the EMR cluster with access to the TPC-DS Big
Data repository”._**\
Next, you have to execute the commands described in the section **_“Observe the fault
tolerance behavior in an EMR cluster using redundancy”_**.

Now, you must execute the query 21 adapted in a cluster with only 4 task nodes and you will
note the time taken for execution is 224 seconds which is almost 4 minutes.
![Scalability3](img/scalability3.png)
Then you have to **_terminate the cluster in the AWS Console_**.\
For the second part of the experiment, you will create a new EMR Cluster but now with the 7
task nodes, which as we saw before is the maximum size of the cluster because of the
restrictions of use of the lab environment and you will connect through the terminal to its public
IP.\
Finally, you must repeat the step of the query but now in a cluster with 7 worker nodes, you will
note the time taken for execution is 186 seconds reducing the time of execution by 17 percent.
![Scalability4](img/scalability4.png)
This is how it has demonstrated the concept of scalability using an EMR cluster in a Big Data
environment, that is, with a greater number of nodes, the execution time of the same task is
shorter.

## Appendix: pre-requisite knowledge; refer to this section if it is unclear how to execute one or more steps in the guide.

To run this experiment in an AWS lab environment, you have to access with your email registered
as **_username_** and your **_password_** to the site https://awsacademy.instructure.com/login/canvas.
Then, in the **_control panel section_**, you need access to the course **_“AWS Academy Learner
Lab [82952]”_**. Next, you must click in the **_“Modules”_** menu and scroll down to enter the section
**_“Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab”_**. Finally, you have to click on the button **_“Start
Lab”_** until the AWS console is green color for launching the console with a click in the **_“AWS”_**
button.
![appendix1](img/appendix1.png)
Here are the steps to help with configurations needed in this lab:
1\. The first step is to create a key pair in the AWS console using the key pairs service:
you have to create a key pair by putting it a name, in this case, called “emr-keypair”
being of RSA type and “.pem” file format. Then you have to download the file for future
usage. The keypair is shown in the console in the following image:
![appendix2](img/appendix2.png)
> Note: Remember to assign the permissions to the file .pem with the command chmod
400 for Linux or Mac.

2\. You will use this key pair when you have to connect to the master node of the EMR
Cluster in this lab. The file is displayed as follows in the visual operative system:
![appendix3](img/appendix3.png)
3\. The second step is to create the security group using the service “Security Groups” for
EC2 with the objective that only you have permission to connect to the master node of
the EMR cluster. You need to assign a name, “ssh-my-ip” and select the default VPC
(virtual private cloud). Just make sure the VPC is in the same zone and region of AWS.
4\. You must create an inbound rule with your IP address as the source, allowing traffic
on port 22 for the SSH protocol. The information created automatically by AWS as ID is
important to use when you create the cluster being the security group ID and subnet ID
generated by default.
![appendix4](img/appendix4.png)
Final and important note: Remember to terminate the EMR cluster after running this laboratory
guide and delete the disk volumes created by default to save costs.

Well done! You used the Amazon EMR service to demonstrate the non-functional properties of
distributed systems like fault-tolerance and auto-scaling through the running of the Spark
Cluster connected to a TPC-DS big data repository in S3.
